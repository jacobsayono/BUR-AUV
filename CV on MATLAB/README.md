# Computer Vision on MATLAB

**This simple MATLAB code detects a desired object in a cluttered environment.**  
- There are 2 examples in this folder: pencil and book.  
- The flyer example does not occur every run due to the limiting nature in the detectSURFFeatures() function and RANSAC algorithm.  
- However, there were a couple runs that were successful in identifying the flyer; I have posted the process of the successful trial with images.  
  
**Future Plans:**  
- Detect objects in moving environment
- Improve accuracy of detected object through a neural network
